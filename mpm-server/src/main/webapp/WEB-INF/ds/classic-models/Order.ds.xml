	  Customers place their orders and expect to receive them approximately within 6 to 10 days. Once an order is placed it’s assembled and shipped within 1 to 6 days (7-8 for Japan). 
	  There are a total of 326 orders, which span the period from 1/1/2003 to 6/1/2005. Orders can be in one of these states: 
	    
	    In Process (the initial state for all orders), 
	    Shipped, 
	    Cancelled (used to indicate that the customer called to cancel the order right after the order was placed and typically before it was shipped), 
	    Disputed (used to indicate that the customer received the order but doesn’t like it), 
	    Resolved (used to indicate that the order was disputed, but successfully resolved) or 
	    On Hold (used to indicate that the order will not ship until a payment is received because the customer’s credit limit has been exceeded). 
	    
      Approximately 93% of the orders are in the Shipped state.
