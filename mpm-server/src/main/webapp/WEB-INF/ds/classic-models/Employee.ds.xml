	  The company has 23 employees: 6 Execs and 17 Sales Reps, all assigned to one of the company’s seven offices. Sales Reps are also assigned to a number of 
	  customers (distributors) in their respective geographies that they sell to. New Sales Reps (that are still in training) don’t have customers assigned to them. 
	  Each Sales Rep reports to the Sales Manager for his/her territory. The only exceptions are the two Sales Reps in the Tokyo office. One of them acts as a 
	  Sales Manager and reports directly to the VP of Sales. The second one reports to him.
	   
      The Execs: President, VP Sales, VP Marketing, Sales Manager (JAPAN, APAC), Sales Manager (EMEA), Sales Manager (NA) don’t work directly with customers. 
      Each Sales Manager reports to the VP of Sales. Nobody reports to the VP of Marketing. The two VPs report to the company’s President.
